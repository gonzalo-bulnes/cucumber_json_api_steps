Some [Cucumber][cucumber] steps to make easier to build [JSON API][json-api] with Rails.

  [json-api]: http://jsonapi.org/

Installation
------------

_Milestone: v1.0.0_

Install [Cucumber][cucumber], then add the gem to your `Gemfile`:
```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem 'cucumber_json_api_steps'
end
```

Usage
-----

**Note**: This usage section acts as a roadmap for development following the [README-driven development][rdd] principles. Not everything that is described here will be available at any moment, however, I'll try to keep things clear in comments.

  [rdd]: http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html

Once installed, you can include the JSON API [steps](#steps) in your features definitions or use the [built-in generators](#generators) to create common features.

Steps
-----

### Base Steps
_Milestone: v1.0.0_

### Scaffolded Resource Steps
_Milestone: v1.0.0_

### Associations Steps
_Milestone: undefined_

### JSON API Steps
_Milestone: undefined_

**Note**: I'm not sure yet that these will be a distinct set of steps, or if all steps will be JSON-API-compliant, however, I think it could be a good thing to keep both concerns separated so you can first build your API and then ensure it complies with the [JSON API][json-api] standard. That would help to refactor existing API to implement the standard.

These steps allow you to ensure the API follows the [JSON API][json-api] standard, which makes it compatible out-of-the-box with clients that follow this standard ([Ember.js][ember] with a `DS.ActiveModelAdapter` from [Ember Data][ember-getting-started] for example).

Documentation
-------------

### Executable documentation

The Cucumber scenarii describe how to setup demonstration applications for different use cases. While you can read the `rake` output, you may prefer to read it in HTML format:

```bash
cd cucumber_json_api_steps
rake features_html # generate the features documentation

# Open doc/features.html in your preferred web browser.
```

### Changelog

Releases are commented to provide a brief [changelog][changelog].

Development
-----------

### Testing

This gem development is test-driven. Each use case should be described with [Cucumber][cucumber] within an example app. That app will be created and configured automatically by [Aruba][aruba] as a [Cucumber][cucumber] (gem-level) feature.

Cucumber generates the example (dummy) app, with its own Cucumber features inside. That might sound a bit scary but isn't that much.
The [Simple Token Authentication][sta] gem features a similar setup involving Cucumber and Aruba at the gem level, and RSpec (instead of Cucumber) inside the dummy app. It may make the pattern more visible.

Anyway, the resulting Cucumber features are a bit verbose, and their output when errors occur is not ideal, but their output when they are passing, on the contrary, provides an easy-to-reproduce recipe to build the example app (see [Executable documentation][exec-doc]). I find that useful enough to be patient with red scenarii.

  [exec-doc]: https://github.com/gonzalo-bulnes/cucumber_json_api_steps#executable-documentation
  [sta]: https://github.com/gonzalo-bulnes/simple_token_authentication

You can run the full test suite with `cd cucumber_json_api_steps && rake`.

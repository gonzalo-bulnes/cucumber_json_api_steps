Cucumber JSON API Steps
=======================

Some [Cucumber][cucumber] steps to make easier to build [JSON API][json-api] with Rails.

  [json-api]: http://jsonapi.org/

Installation
------------

_Milestone: v1.0.0_

Install [Cucumber][cucumber], then add the gem to your `Gemfile`:
```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem 'cucumber_json_api_steps'
end
```

Usage
-----

**Note**: This usage section acts as a roadmap for development following the [README-drive development][rdd] principles. Not everything that is described here will be available at any moment, however, I'll try to keep things clear in comments.

Once installed, you can include the JSON API [steps](#steps) in your features definitions or use the [build-in generators](#generators) to create common features.

Steps
-----

### Base Steps
_Milestone: v1.0.0_

### Scaffolded Resource Steps
_Milestone: v1.0.0_

### Associations Steps
_Milestone: undefined_

### JSON API Steps
_Milestone: undefined_

**Note**: I'm not sure yet that these will be a distinct set of steps, or if all steps will be JSON-API-compliant, however, I think it could be a good thing to keep both concerns separated so you can first build your API and then ensure it complies with the [JSON API][json-api] standard. That would help to migrate existing API to implement the standard.

This steps allow you to ensure the API follows the [JSON API][json-api] standard, which makes it compatible out-of-the-box with clients that follow this standard ([Ember.js][ember] with a `DS.ActiveModelAdapter` from [Ember Data][ember-getting-started] for example).
